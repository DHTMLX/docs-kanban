# GET `/links`

### Description

@short: Gets data on all links and returns a json object with an array of links objects

The route handles the **HTTP GET** request made to the `/links` path.

### Payload

No payload is required.

### Response

The route returns a json object with an array of all links objects.

Example:

~~~json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "masterId": 2,
        "slaveId": 5,
        "relation": "relatesTo",
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "masterId": 4,
        "slaveId": 9,
        "relation": "relatesTo",
    },
]
~~~

For another example of the returned object, go to [**links**](api/config/js_kanban_links_config.md).

The HTTP status code shows whether the request succeeds (response.status == 200) or fails (response.status == 500).
