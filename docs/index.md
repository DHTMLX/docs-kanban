# JavaScript Kanban overview

JavaScript Kanban is an effective solution for the workflow visualization. The widget helps you better understand your business processes and gain an overview of your team workload. This flexible tool can work with any number of cards. Fully written in pure JavaScript and CSS, the component can be easily set and customized as well as integrated into any web app or web page.

## Kanban structure
