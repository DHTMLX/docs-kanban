# DHTMLX Kanban overview

JavaScript Kanban is an effective solution for the workflow visualization. The widget helps you better understand your business processes and gain an overview of your team workload. This flexible tool can work with any number of cards, columns and swimlanes. Fully written in pure JavaScript and CSS, the component can be easily set and customized as well as integrated into any web app or web page.

## Kanban structureÂ­

### Toolbar

**Toolbar** of Kanban is a separate part of the interface. It includes a search bar for *searching* cards, a control for *sorting* cards by the specified parameters, two controls for managing history (*undo/redo*) and controls for *adding new columns and rows*. You can flexibly manage the searching and sorting logic as well as change the Toolbar structure by adding custom elements or changing the order of the built-in ones. Read more in the [Configuration](./guides/configuration#toolbar) section.
